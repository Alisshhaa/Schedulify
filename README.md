# Schedulify
Schedulify is an interactive web application that aims to simplify the understanding of CPU scheduling algorithms through visualizations. The goal is to help students and learners better comprehend the execution logic of algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.

Users can input custom process data and visualize the scheduling through Gantt charts, process tables, and performance metrics like turnaround time and waiting time. The project promotes active learning with step-by-step simulations and comparisons of algorithms.
